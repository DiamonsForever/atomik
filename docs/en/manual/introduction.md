Atomik is a free, open-source, micro framework for PHP5. Atomik tries not to be
yet another framework. It has been built on the idea that there's no simple yet
complete tools for small to medium websites. 
Atomik is build with the KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

beginners to the world of web development frameworks.
