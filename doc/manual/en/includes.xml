	<title>Includes</title>
	<para>
		Includes are php files containing common logic that you 
		include in your actions.
	</para>
	<para>
		Includes are stored in the <filename>app/includes</filename> and/or
		<filename>app/libraries</filename> directories.
	</para>
	<para>
		To include a file from one of these directories use the
		<methodname>Atomik::needed()</methodname> method. It takes as first
		argument the path to the filename you wish to include relative to the
		previous directories and without the extension.
	</para>
	<example>
		<title>Using includes</title>
		<para>
			Let's say we've created the file <filename>app/includes/common.php</filename>
		</para>
		<programlisting>
			<![CDATA[
Atomik::needed('common');]]>
		</programlisting>
		<para>
			You can use sub directories. To include a file stored at
			<filename>app/includes/libs/db.php</filename>:
		</para>
		<programlisting>
			<![CDATA[
Atomik::needed('libs/db');]]>
		</programlisting>
	</example>
	<para>
		<methodname>Atomik::needed()</methodname> also allows you to include classes using
		their name. To do so, classes have to follow the PEAR naming convention
		(<link xlink:href="http://pear.php.net/manual/en/standards.naming.php">http://pear.php.net/manual/en/standards.naming.php</link>).

Atomik::needed('Atomik_Db');]]>
		</programlisting>
	</example>
	<note>
		<para>
			Since Atomik 2.1, <methodname>Atomik::needed()</methodname> is automatically registered as
			an spl_autoload handler.
